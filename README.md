<p id="description">This repository contains a machine learning model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The model is built using historical credit card transaction data and is trained to identify transactions that are likely fraudulent.</p>

## Project Overview

The project consists of two main files:
  1. `fraud_detection_model.pkl`: A trained machine learning model serialized using Python's pickle module.
  2. `credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing the steps for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving the model.

The primary goal of this repository is to predict the likelihood of a transaction being fraudulent, given a set of features.

## Requirements

This project requires the following Python libraries:

    pandas
    numpy
    scikit-learn
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    pickle
    ipykernel (for Jupyter notebook)
